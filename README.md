# People_Tracking_ParrotAR_Drone
Here we present an autonomous people detection and tracking using a Parrot AR-Drone (version 2.0) as a part of our semester project jointly at Eurecom and Telecom Paris-tech. People detection is done using Histogram of Gradient (HOG) feature and tracking with a particle filter. All the control commands are implemented in ROS Hydro using Open-CV library.
