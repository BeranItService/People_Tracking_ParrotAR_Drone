People_Tracking_ParrotAR_Drone
-----
Code for autonomous people detection and tracking using a Parrot AR-Drone (version 2.0) as a part of a semester project jointly at Eurecom and Telecom ParisTech. People detection is done using Histogram of Gradient (HOG) feature and tracking with a particle filter. All the control commands are implemented in ROS Hydro using Open-CV library.

How to run the demos?
---------------------

#1. Install dependencies

[ ] Boost: "sudo apt-get install libboost-dev"
	because ROS (or ardrone_autonomy) using boost 1.46 in default, so we shouldn't use higher version of boost (1.54) 

[ ] SDL: "sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev"

[ ] ROS: "www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation"

[ ] ardrone_autonomy: "https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy#installation", but use "/opt/ros/groovy/stacks" instead of "~/ros/stacks"

after install ROS correctly, the enviroment variable ROS_PAKAGE_PATH (use command "env" to check):
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

for the problem with compiling ardrone_autonomy "rosmake ardrone_autonomy" (mkdir: cannot create directory 'build': Permission denied)
https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy/issues/11
--> change permission of folder ardrone_autonomy
	sudo chmod 777 -R ardrone_autonomy/

[ ] install NTP server for synchronize time between 2 laptop
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=862620
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-time-synchronization-on-ubuntu-12-04
http://rbgeek.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/time-synchronization-on-ubuntu-12-04lts-using-ntp/

FOR SERVER:
install ntpd:
sudo aptitude install ntpd

change server address to European  /etc/ntp.conf:
server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 2.europe.pool.ntp.org
server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
restart service:
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart

add this line into /etc/ntp.conf in order to other PCs can synchronize together
restrict 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
because I manually setup 2 PC as 192.168.2.20 (server) and 192.168.2.30 (client)

open ports:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --sport 123 -j ACCEPT

FOR CLIENT:
update time from client to server:
ntpdate 192.168.2.20 

we can check by change time in client, update and see what will happen.

#2. Ensure the right camera calibration for your drone

[ ] before using a new drone for the first time, calibrate both of its cameras: "www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration"
[ ] initially and when switching your drone, copy or symlink "data/calib<DRONE'S_SERIAL_NUMBER>/*" into "~/.ros/camera_info/"
my Dir: /opt/ros/stacks/ardrone_autonomy/data/camera_info

#3. Build

[ ] "cd code/libHawaii && make && cd ../demoARDrone && make", adjust paths in "{libHawaii,demoARDrone}/config.mk" in case of missing headers or libraries

Linking to boost library (filesystem, iostreams, serialization). Add these line into demoDrone/config.mk
LIBS_ALL += -lboost_iostreams
LIBS_ALL += -lboost_serialization
LIBS_ALL += -lboost_filesystem
This is the example in case we want to link to another libraries of boost

#4. Run

[ ] run ROS middleware: "roslaunch data/ardrone.launch"
[ ] run the actual demo: "./bin/demoARDrone"

if we have any problem with gamepad in run-time: Logitech F{3,5,7}10 or Microsoft Xbox gamepad in XInput mode required, in case don't have any gamepad to test, we can remove this asser error in file appBase.cpp
HAWAII_ERROR_CONDITIONAL( strcmp( SDL_JoystickName( 0 ), "Generic X-Box pad" ) != 0
		                       || SDL_JoystickNumAxes(    gamepadHandle ) != 6
		                       || SDL_JoystickNumBalls(   gamepadHandle ) != 0
		                       || SDL_JoystickNumButtons( gamepadHandle ) != 11 // developer note: I only found eight.
		                       || SDL_JoystickNumHats(    gamepadHandle ) != 1,
		                          "Logitech F{3,5,7}10 or Microsoft Xbox gamepad in XInput mode required" ) ;
---> but lead to a segmentation fault (don't know how to fixed it yet)
